Questions:

	- What differences (if any) do you notice in output? Why?
		- When the quanta was set to 2, the output of the print statements were all the values that script3.txt (the third program) set. This is because script1.txt runs its first quanta and executes its first 2 set statements and then the values of the the variables are overwritten when script2.txt runs its quanta. Similarly when script2.txt sets its variables they are overwitten with script3.txt. Thus, since all the scripts start with setting the same 4 variable (a-d), only the values set by script3 remain. 
		- When the quanta is set to 5, the output are all values of script3 with the exception of the first printed variable which is a2. This is beacuse in script2 first quanta, it sets a-d to a2-d2 and then prints the value of a which is a2. When script 3 runs its quanta, it overwrites the variables and thus when script1 prints a-d and then script 2 prints b-d and then script3 prints b-d all the values are a3-d3. 
		- When the quanta is set to 20, each script can run to completion as their length is less than the quanta length. Thus, the output is a1-d1,a2-d2,a3-d3 as each script sets its variables and then prints them before they can be overwritten or interupted. 

	- What differences (if any) do you notice in the execution time? Why?
		- The average CPU cycles decreased as the quanta was increased. This is due to the "cpu" being interupted less frequently when the quanta is increased (never when quanta = 20) and thus there is less "loss" for stopping the cpu, swapping proccesses and updating the pcbs.  

	- How would the results change if quanta was an amount of time that the processes are allowed to run, instead of a number of code lines? 
		- Since the "help" and "print" commands make system calls they will take much longer to perform than "set". Thus, the set commands should behave similarly, but the print and help commands will take longer to execute and depending on your quanta, it could only perform a couple syscall commands until the quanta is over. Therefore, the results would behave more closely to that of quanta = 2 or quanta = 5, as the "set"s will run and thus most of the variables will have the value of script3.
